# Journey
I've been warned that this project is gonna take sometime and it's the most important way to evaluate my technical skills, so I decided I'm gonna learn some new technologies while getting it done for two reasons 
1. Use the time I'm investing in this project to learn something new 
2. Demonstrate that I can pick up new technologies fast

This is a list of the new technologies I started learning/using meanwhile working on this project 
- Redux toolkit 
- Redux Saga
- React testing library
- Styled components
- CircleCi
